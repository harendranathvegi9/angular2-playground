# Angular 2 playground

This is a very simple setup I use to quickly play around with Angular 2
when Plunker is not enough.

## Setup

Use node 4+ and npm 3+.

```
$ npm i
```

## Run

Execute the TypeScript compiler in one shell window

```
$ npm run tsc
```

and in another terminal window

```
$ npm start
```

...to start the app in the browser.
